Searching through an array[unknow] is O(n). But what is the elements of the array are not just integers instead live
entities which can speak for themseleves, which can tell what they are. 

You shout at a crowd who is Forest Gump. He would definitely come out and say I am. What is the order of it. O(1).

But these entities [miccro dosts] are costly , costly to survive , costly to function. 

Currently i am simulating them as lightweight threads. These would be activated once a notifier notifies them. we when
shouted became the Panel. And the room which we all are in as a channel. 

Considering this thoery some POJO classes are created within this repo and a simulation room.
