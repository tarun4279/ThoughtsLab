Simulation on an ideal world.

Consider that a world comprises of three types of people, namely, positive, negative and neutral. The people going to vote for an upcoming election may choose to give a positive vote, negative vote respectively. A positive vote would be chosen by positive people while the people who have negative feedback on the nominated candidate, would vote negative. The last category of people remains  that of the neutral. Neutral people would vote as per the majority of the people since they themselves do not have a viewpoint.
In a situation where the positive votes are equal to the negative votes, the final(last vote) vote would be counted for the decision.
For example:
For a total of 18 people existing in the world, the number of permutations will be 36004. If equal number of positive, negative and neutral people exist(6each), the possibilities of a tie are 36004.

The inference that can be drawn is, people cast their vote as per the majority votes without even thinking who should be voted for the best results.
